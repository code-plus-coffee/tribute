        <p class="content">
          Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist,
          and political ethicist, who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the
          successful campaign for India's independence from British Rule,
          and in turn inspire movements for civil
          rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā,
          first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa,
          is now used throughout the world.

        <h2 class="head">Early Life</h2>
        <p class="content">
          Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869
          into an Indian Gujarati Hindu Modh Baniya family in
          Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the
          Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of
          the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the
          Indian Empire. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885),
          served as the diwan (chief minister) of Porbandar state.

        <h2 class="head">Struggle for Indian Independence</h2>
        <h3 class="head">Role in World War I</h3>
        <p class="content">
          In April 1918, during the latter part of World War I,
          the Viceroy invited Gandhi to a War Conference in
          Delhi. Gandhi agreed to actively recruit Indians for the war effort.
        </p>

        <h3 class="head">Champaran Agitations</h3>
        <p class="content">
          Gandhi's first major achievement came in 1917 with the
          Champaran agitation in Bihar. The Champaran agitation
          pitted the local peasantry against their largely British landlords
          who were backed by the local administration.
        </p>

        <h3 class="head">Kheda Agitations</h3>
        <p class="content">
          In 1918, Kheda was hit by floods and famine and the peasantry
          was demanding relief from taxes. Gandhi moved his headquarters
          to Nadiad, organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers
          from the region, the most notable being Vallabhbhai Patel.
        </p>

        <h3 class="head">Khilafat Movement</h3>
        <p class="content">
          In 1919 after the World War I was over, Gandhi (aged 49) sought
          political co-operation from Muslims in his fight against
          British imperialism by supporting the Ottoman Empire that had been
          defeated in the World War.
        </p>

        <h3 class="head">Non Co-operation</h3>
        <p class="content">
          With his book Hind Swaraj (1909) Gandhi, aged 40, declared that
          British rule was established in India with the co-operation of
          Indians and had survived only because of this co-operation.
          If Indians refused to co-operate, British rule would collapse
          and swaraj would come.
        </p>

        <h3 class="head">Salt Satyagraha</h3>
        <p class="content">
          After his early release from prison for political crimes in 1924,
          over the second half of the 1920s, Gandhi continued to pursue swaraj.
          He pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December
          1928 calling on the British government to grant India dominion status
          or face a new campaign of non-co-operation with complete independence
          for the country as its goal.
        </p>

        <h3 class="head">World War II & Quit India Movement</h3>
        <p class="content">
          Gandhi opposed providing any help to the British war effort and
          he campaigned against any Indian participation in the World War II.
          Gandhi's campaign did not enjoy the support of Indian masses and many
          Indian leaders such as Sardar Patel and Rajendra Prasad.
          His campaign was a failure. Over 2.5 million Indians ignored Gandhi,
          volunteered and joined the British military to fight on various fronts of
          the allied forces.
        </p>

        <h3 class="head">Partition & Independence</h3>
        <p class="content">
          Gandhi opposed partition of the Indian subcontinent along religious lines.
          The Indian National Congress and Gandhi called for the British to Quit India.
          However, the Muslim League demanded "Divide and Quit India".
        </p>

        <h3 class="head">Death</h3>
        <p class="content">
          At 5:17 pm on 30 January 1948, Gandhi was with his grandnieces in the
          garden of Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti), on his way to address a prayer
          meeting, when Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, fired three bullets
          into his chest from a pistol at close range.
